 * 
 * Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) 
 * is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are 
 * combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before 
 * validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been
 * unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an 
 * integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the 
 * integrated system ready for system testing.
